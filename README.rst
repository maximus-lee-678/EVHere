EVHere Prototype
================

| Originally developed under the name **team_15_flask_react**, with the goal of
| **Webpage development and data processing for electric vehicle charging management and machine learning analysis**.
|
* Includes an interactive webpage which supports the display of and interaction with Electric Vehicle chargers in Singapore.
* Machine Learning is performed on Historical EV data to predict upcoming prices.
* Photovoltaic voltage is able to be read from Solar Panels and uploaded to the Website Backend Database.

ðŸ›  Setup (Webpage)
------------------

1. Download and install `Node JS <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_.

2. To initialise backend python packages, run:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. To initialise backend database with random values, run:

.. code-block:: console

  generate_db_files.bat

4. To initialise frontend node packages, run:

.. code-block:: console

  cd react && update.bat

5. Once steps 1-4 are completed, run the server with:

.. code-block:: console

  start.bat

| On the first run, the Flask backend may take a while to initialise database values.
| This may cause frontend errors since the backend is unresponsive.
| Simply wait for the backend to load and the webpage will function normally again.
